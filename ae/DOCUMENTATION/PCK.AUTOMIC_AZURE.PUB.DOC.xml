=Actions=

Following actions are supported for Azure.

* Action Name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.GET_SUBSCRIPTION_INFO
Action Description: This action is used to fetch Subscription details from Azure system as per the specified Subscription Id. We also need to specify the path to authentication certificate (keystore .jks file) and certificate password in order to connect to Azure system. The Output of this action will be an xml printed in the Job report containing detailed information of the specified Azure Subscription.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.CHANGE_VM_STATE
Action description: This action is used to change the virtual machine state (start ,restart ,shutdown and shutdown & deallocate). Difference between shutdown and shutdown deallocate is that later will release all the resources accquired by the Virtual machine. This action will return request id which can be further used to query the status of the action.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.CHECK_REQUEST_STATUS
Action description: This action is used to fetch the status of a previously submitted Azure request based on the request id provided by user. The request status is stored and published in an AE variable. The value of request status will be either Succeeded, InProgress or Failed. This action will fail if user provides an invalid request id which does not exist in Azure system.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.DELETE_VM
Action description: This action is used to delete the given virtual machine in the cloud service. The action will return the request id which can be further queried to get the status of this action. Also, if delete attached media is selected YES then it will delete all the associated media (operating system disk.data disk and the source blobs) not the container.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.CREATE_VM_DEPLOYMENT
Action description: The Create Virtual Machine Deployment Action creates a deployment and then creates a Virtual Machine in that deployment based on the provided xml configuration file and service name. If action executed successfully, it will return request status id that will be used to check status of executed action.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.CREATE_STORAGE_CONTAINER
Action description: This action is used to create a Container in the Azure Storage account provided by the user. The Container is created based on the storage account information(account name and access key) and parameters like container name and access type.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.DELETE_STORAGE_CONTAINER
Action description: This action is used to delete a Container in the Azure Storage account provided by the user. The Delete Container action marks the specified container for deletion. The container and any blobs contained within it are later deleted during garbage collection. To call this action on a container that has an active lease, specify the lease ID.

* Action Name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.PUT_BLOB
Action Description: The Put Blob action uploads a new block blob. The content of the existing blob is overwritten with the content of the new blob and overwrites any existing metadata on the blob. Partial updates are not supported with Put Blob. The default MIME type is application/octet-stream. Using this action user can save his/her contents(images, videos, documents etc.) in the form of blob for future usage. This action will also publish the blob name in AE variable on successful upload.

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.CREATE_CLOUD_SERVICE
Action description: This action is used to create cloud service in Microsoft Azure asynchronously at specified geographical location by user. This action will return request id which can be further used to query the status of the action.

*Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.DELETE_BLOB
Action description: This action is used to delete the blob or its snapshots or both as per the specified inputs from Storage container in Microsoft Azure.

*Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.VNET_CONFIGURATION

*Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.DELETE_CLOUD_SERVICE
Action description: This action will delete an existing cloud service in Microsoft Azure as per the specified inputs. Output of this action will be a request status id which will be stored in AE variable.This action is executed in asynchronous mode only if Delete attached media = true

* Action name: PCK.AUTOMIC_AZURE.PUB.ACTION.DELETE_DEPLOYMENT
Action description: This action will delete an existing deployment in Microsoft Azure as per the specified inputs. Output of this action will be a request status id which will be stored in AE variable. You could either delete deployment based on deployment slots or a deployment name. User could also delete Operating system disk, attached data disks, and the source blobs for the disks from storage using appropriate flag.]]></DOC>
